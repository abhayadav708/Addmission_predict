- **University Rating**: Rating of the university (1 to 5).
- **SOP**: Statement of Purpose strength (1 to 5).
- **LOR**: Letter of Recommendation strength (1 to 5).
- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average (out of 10).
- **Research**: Whether the student has research experience (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Admission_Predict.csv`, which contains historical admission data.
